`Impeller <http://impeller.e43.eu/>`- An Android client for `Pump.io <http://pump.io>`
======================================================================================

What is it
==========

An early, quite incomplete client for Pump.io which runs on Android Ice Cream
Sandwich and later.

At present, it solves only ~10% of the problem: getting your feed and notifying 
you of updates. Fortunately, thats' the most important 10%.

For my future directions, see `this post <https://microca.st/oshepherd/note/Rtud1lE6TzKxdo8YC47Hhg>`
